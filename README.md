Almost everyone gets to be asked about algorithms during interviews. It has been a long time ago that I actually got to play with algorithms in any detail. This library is my attempt to get back to the __roots__.

There is nothing intrinsically valuable in this library except maybe the implementations themselves. The primary use for me is to implement each well-(or less-)known algorithm I could put my hands on.

*And yes, there's even a binary search in there. Hey, you have to start small when practicing!*
