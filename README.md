# Abacaxi [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ckq7nanjy3nms8a7?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pavkam/abacaxi)

*"No code library is complete without a binary search!"*

I'm building this library as a repository of algorithms, data structures and helper methods that make one's daily programming life easier (in .NET that is).

__At a later point I might even include some description of what's available!__
