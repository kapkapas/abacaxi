# Abacaxi [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ckq7nanjy3nms8a7?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pavkam/abacaxi)

*"No code library is complete without a binary search!"*

I'm building this library as a repository of algorithms, data structures and helper methods that make one's daily programming life easier (in .NET that is).

Abacaxi is available on NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Abacaxi/ and is built against __.NET Framework 4.5.__

### The list of supported data structures, algorithms, and helper methods (so far!):
| Entity | Description |
| --- |:---:|
| **Heap&lt;T&gt;** | Implements the **heap** data structure (also known as **priority queue**). See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)> |
| **BitSet** | Implements the standard **ISet&lt;int&gt;** data structure in an optimized form (using bit masks). See related material here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_array> |
