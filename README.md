# Abacaxi [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ckq7nanjy3nms8a7?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pavkam/abacaxi)

*"No code library is complete without a binary search!"*

I'm building this library as a repository of algorithms, data structures and helper methods that make one's daily programming life easier (in .NET that is).

Abacaxi is available on NuGet: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Abacaxi/ and is built against __.NET Standard 1.1 (compatible with .NET Framework 4.5).__

At a later point I might even include some description of what's available! Until that time, you can browse the source code, maybe something interesting will pop up!
